In this document I am chronicling my process of learning to use vim, as well as noting different shortcuts I am using and might want to use along the way.

# Commands List

## Learning


## To learn
* gi = insert mode at last location 

## Learned


## Backlog
* mm to mark, m to go to mark, mM to mark cross-file (need to test this)
* g; to navigate changelist
* get vim working in powershell:  install the Vim windows official from its website, select the option to include .bat files during installation. Then go to powershell, type Vim and your editor will open.
