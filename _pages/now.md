<p>A list of what I'm focusing on now. Inspired by <a href="https://thomasjfrank.com/now/">Thomas Frank</a> who was inspired by <a href="https://sive.rs/now">Derek Sivers</a>.</p>

<p>My main priorities at the moment are:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>House-spousing:</strong> Supporting my wife in her work by keeping the house clean, getting meals cooked and having spare emotional and physical capacity to lend emotional or practical support as needed.</li><li><strong>Working: </strong>Keeping our budget balanced by earning supplementary income, and saving up for dedicated time off</li><li><strong><a href="https://dunkonit.github.io/roadmap/">Getting into IT:</a></strong> Try and transition to a career in IT. I'll be expanding on my existing project management skills, as well as nurturing my love of/affinity for system design and technical writing. I'd love to also work on some actual coding on the side. </li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Parallel to those, I'm trying to do a bunch of things:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li><strong>Rebuild my body: </strong>Through regular rehab exercises and stretching, I'm trying to (a) maintain a pain-free life, and (b) start building towards more rigorous (and enjoyable) exercise routines like calisthenics and running.</li><li><strong>Digital intentionalism:</strong> To the degree I use social media and the like, let it be to further my knowledge about and passion for IT, rather than mindless scrolling and distraction. On top of that, I have found video games to be a great way to rest after a mentally intense day - so we're ok with an hour or two of those per day.</li><li><strong>Maintaining my spiritual and mental health:</strong> Keeping my anxiety under control, but also developing a daily practice that keeps me connected to God and myself. Not sure what this looks like currently, but writing is a big part of it.</li></ul>

<p>Since my last entry, we have a much clearer direction - I'm enjoying my paid work a lot more, and am very excited to get more into the IT world. This means lots of time at a computer, however, so cultivating a good practice of taking breaks will be very important for my day-to-day health. Also housework has been slipping a bit, so I need to keep that up.</p>
