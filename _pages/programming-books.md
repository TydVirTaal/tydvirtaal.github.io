A list of the books I want to, and have, read around programming.

# Reading

## The Mythical Man-Month
- very interesting at the start, but beginning to fall off a bit after 20%. More related to the organisation of software teams than it is related to coding directly, thinking of trying something else.

# To Read
* The Pragmatic Programmer
* Coders at Work
* Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code, 2nd Edition

# Backlog
_Roughly ranked list of books I'd like to read._
* Code Complete: a Practical Handbook of Software Construction, 2nd Edition
* Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship (quite java-specific, but still interesting)
* Head First Design Patterns: A Brain-Friendly Guide (seems to cover some fairly advanced topics)
* Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software 
* Working Effectively With Legacy Code (not relevant to me until I'm looking to work on an existing codebase)
* The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers (sounds somewhat dubious, also relates to developing software in teams/an organisation - perhaps read the parts of it relevant to me now and skip the org-related sections?)
