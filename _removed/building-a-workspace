What is stopping me going mouseless:
* Browser dialogs (eg, file download, password interface)
* Alternative to Notion for project management


Changes I need to make:

* terminal
    * scroll up in terminal 
* vscode
    * better way of indenting lines while in insert mode 
    * better way of swapping between file browser and code editor vscode
* i3 customisations
    * vim keybindings for moving between monitors 
    * prettify screen
    * set icons for desktops
    * plan out desktops properly 
* try out tmux (not sure if its needed)
* vim 
    * try vim with a decent vimrc file, compare to vscode 
    * try out vim with code completion
* explore other elements of mouseless dev mentioned in videos

* look at doing a full install of linux? 
    * ubuntu? ideally I want something more lightweight 
    * arch?
