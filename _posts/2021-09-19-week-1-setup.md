This was the week where I decided I needed to formalise my learning process in order to (a) retain my sanity, and (b) keep making progress. 

What I did this week: 
- Deploy v0 of cubing.js Documentation Website
- Figured out a "professional" username, started to harmonise that (small but also big)
- Deployed personal website
- Built out `Getting into IT` (GiIT) roadmap
- Built learning management/project management system in Notion 
- Flirted with Obsidian

What I'm focusing on next week: 
- Setting up Obsidian note-taking system
- Powering through as much "NEED to learn" as possible
