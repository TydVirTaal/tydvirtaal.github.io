This was the week where I decided I needed to formalise my learning process in order to (a) retain my sanity, and (b) keep making progress. 

What I did this week: 
- Deployed v0 of [cubing.js Documentation Website](https://dunkonit.github.io/cubing.js/)
- Figured out a "professional" username, started to harmonise that (small but also big)
- Deployed blog/portfolio website (this one)
- Built out `Getting into IT` (GiIT) [roadmap](../_pages/getting-into-IT-the-roadmap.md)
- Built [learning management/project management system](https://opposite-guava-d65.notion.site/Getting-into-IT-Learning-and-Project-Management-b3171e0f2d024efd8f80410cdd6fcd47) in `Notion` 
- Flirted with `Obsidian` for note-taking

What I'm focusing on next week: 
- Setting up `Obsidian` note-taking system
- Powering through as much "NEED to learn" (Notion > Learning Management) as possible
